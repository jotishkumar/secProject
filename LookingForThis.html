    <h3>What are Ferns?</h3>
    <p>
        Ferns are plants that do not have flowers. Ferns generally reproduce by producing spores. 
        Similar to flowering plants, ferns have roots, stems and leaves. However, unlike flowering plants, 
        ferns do not have flowers or seeds; instead,they usually reproduce sexually by 
        tiny spores or sometimes can reproduce vegetatively.
